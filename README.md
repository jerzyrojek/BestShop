# BestShop

A sample landing page of an imaginary shop. It is based on an Adobe XD Project and showcases information that could be important to a user who is visitting the site for the first time such as:

- Call to action
- Benefits of the platform
- Package pricing
- Price calculator
- Contact form

## Description

Project created for learning purposes. Originally coded in HTML/CSS at the beginning of a bootcamp. Later on refactored to Sass and React as well as made responsive. While it would probably be easier to write it from scratch, I thought refactoring my old code would provide a better challenge. This was my first React project.

## Tech stack

- React
- SCSS

## Installation
